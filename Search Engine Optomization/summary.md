How does the Search Engine Work
- KEYWORD -> Page -> Link -> Keyword -> Page.
- Keywords are search terms.
- Search Engine Indexing is done by crawlers.
- The Crawler goes to one of your pages, sees what keywords you have on your page, saves those keywords, and navigates to links on that page.
- The Process is repeated on the next page.

How to improve your ranking
- Make navigation on your site easy
- Check what top-ranking sites are doing

Mobilegeddon
- Websites that are not mobile friendly are penalized, this is because the amount of mobile traffic on the internet is ever increasing
- Websites that load faster have higher rankings, because most people won't wait longer than five seconds for a site to load
