Outline:
- Intro to Redux (What is it?)



- An attempt at making Redux easier to understand
- Things it does for your project
- Things I learnt you shouldn't do with Redux
- Testing
- Middleware
- Do you need it?

In my experience the audience at the user group is usually a mixed bunch; - people who've never heard of thing thing you're talking about. people who have a little experience with the thing, people who've used the thing a lot. I think this is probably true for Redux, so I want to structure the talk to cater for all levels of audience.

Synopsis;

Redux is a seemingly complicated stage management tool, but it doesn't need to be.
Together we will attempt to break Redux down to a simpler form, so that the lifecycle is almost transparent.
Redux can easily be used with React, Vue, and Angular, so we'll look at testing, some of the side effects of Redux, some of the things you shouldn't do.

Let me know what you think, I'm worried there'll be too much to cover.

Kind Regards,
